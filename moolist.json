As we are a new MOO, I offer special benefits and rewards to builders especially who will build for the public MOO, and some benefits also for public programmers. I am also currently writing a MUD system which will allow for both MOO and MUD (either basically is optional  though) for the players. You will not be required to play the MUD, or play the MOO really, except for certain things that might be necessary (I am still developing this, so to say what it will be like is impossible).
